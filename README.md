# Arpeggimate

A dating app designed to encourage healthy conversation. Once a user has created an account and logged in, they will be immediately welcomed to the main page where there is a randomized user from the database that fits their preferences criteria. The user can click 'yes' or 'no' to either notify that person or to simply move on to the next person. If the user clicks 'yes', the person whom they liked will be notified and will be prompted to engage with the person in private chat.
