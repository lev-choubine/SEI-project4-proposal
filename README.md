# Dating App

A dating app designed to encourage healthy conversation where users can register and look for matches based on the set criteria. Once a user has created an account and logged in, they will be immediately welcomed to the main page where there is a randomized user from the database that fits their preferences criteria. The user can click 'yes' or 'no' to either notify that person or to simply move on to the next person. Once they find a match the request is made to chat.
